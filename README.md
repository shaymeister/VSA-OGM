## VSA-OGM - Occupancy Grid Mapping in 2D

In this application of bio-inspired vector symbolic architectures, we employ a novel hyperdimensional occupancy grid mapping system with Shannon entropy. For the most in-depth exploration of our experiments and results, please take a look at [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09066).

### Directory Structure

- **dataloaders**: individual classes to lead different dataset formats
- **datasets**: the Intel map and single-agent toysim datasets
- **experiments**: script files to run the single and multi-agent experiments with the toysim and Intel datasets
- **notebooks**: tools to evaluate against EviLOG, run the ablation study, evaluate runtime performance, and perform Shannon-based entropy extraction
- **metrics.py**: functions to calculate TP and FP rates along with AUC
- **plotting.py**: functions to visualize statistical results
- **utilities.py**: functions to split training dataset into train and test sets

###

The VSA-OGM is wrapped together as a single pip package. You must pre-install pytorch depending on your specific machine and the semantic pointer library (spl). SPL is included in this repo as a second directory. You can locally install the library with the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

It has currently been tested on MacOS and Ubuntu with CPU and CUDA 11.7. Other operating systems and CUDA versions should be supported but it has not been formally tested.

### Datasets

- Toy Sim (Single Agent): included in `datasets`
- Toy Sim (Fusion): download [Agent 1](https://gmuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ssnyde9_gmu_edu/EVNScsJma1lMpQmTgLmBmBoBaVgLRgwrIcVRiWLAOtHiqA?e=GrE7eq) and [Agent 2](https://gmuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ssnyde9_gmu_edu/ETE2c01yROlIkH3-gLSo7vsBIKKOt1S_fgdVfthFgEgW3Q?e=aEAXiM)
- Intel (Single Agent): included in `datasets`
- Intel (Fusion): generate with [this notebook](./notebooks/datasets/intel_map_fusion_data.ipynb)
- EviLOG: download according to [their repository](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/EviLOG)

### Experiments

Both the Intel map and Toy sim single agent experiments can be recreated with `vsa_map_single.py` in the `experiments` directory.

Conversely, the fusion experiments can be duplicated with `vsa_map_fusion.py` in the same directory. The runtime processing and entropy based information extraction were done with Jupyter in the `notebooks` directory.

We trained EviLOG with the author's codebase. Our evaluation on their dataset was conducted with Jupyter in the `notebooks/datasets` directory.
